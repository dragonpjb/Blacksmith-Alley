				<h1>Upsetting</h1>
				<p>Upsetting is the process of making a bar shorter and thicker by heating and striking the end causing the heated area to spread.</p>

				<h2>Heating</h2>
				<p>The length to be upset should be heated evenly to a bright white heat. The heat should not extend far from the area to be thickened. If the heat goes further, the rod or bar might buckle. </p>

				<h2>Jumping Up</h2>
				<p>A heavy bar of steel can be upset by repeatedly striking it on an iron block on the floor.This process is called jumping up, it has the advantage of letting the weight of the bar do most of the work for you.</p>

				<h2>Upsetting Smaller Pieces</h2>
				<p>For a shorter piece of iron it is best to hold it on the anvil and strike the cold end with a hammer. Several reheat will probably be needed to get a worth while amount of upsetting.</p>

			<div id="l-4" class="col-2 left">
				<h2>Backing Up</h2>
				<p>In most cases, upsetting is best started by jumping up. Once spreading an shortening has started, the process can be continued with backing up blows from the hammer. Have the end at a good heat. Hold it so that it projects over the edge of the anvil, with  your holding hand braced against your thigh , ready to resist the shock of hammering. Hit the end strongly while rotating the rod between blows so as to get an even effect.</p>
