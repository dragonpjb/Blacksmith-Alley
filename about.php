				This sites primary goal is to provide an organized hassle-free 
				knowledge base dedicated to provding the "keys" of understanding 
				to a world that has been locked away by those of us who feel 
				that ones knowledge is their own, and thus, long since forgotten.
			</p>
			
			<p class="about left">
				My objective is to rectify this "obscene" in-justice for, 
				it is my humble opinion that knowledge is meant to be spread 
				through-out the the word to all those who seek it. Breaking 
				the "confining" chains of limitation. Free of restrictions or 
				any monetary gain for, America is the land of the free, and 
				freedom of knowledge is the right of every living being for, 
				without knowledge...there is no freedom.
